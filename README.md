# Recyclable.Collections
Recyclable.Collections project is an open source framework for operating dynamic lists at performance close to raw arrays. It aims at providing with minimal memory footprint. It implements IList&lt;T&gt;'s interface and is targeted as direct replacements of List&lt;T&gt;, SortableList&lt;T&gt;, PriorityQueue&lt;T&gt; and similar.
